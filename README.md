### Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project provides information about various aspects related to diabetes.

### Types of Diabetes
Type 1 Diabetes:
An autoimmune disease.
The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas, where insulin is made.
About 10 percent of people with diabetes have this type.
Type 2 Diabetes:

Occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin, leading to a buildup of sugar in the blood.
Prediabetes:

Blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
Gestational Diabetes:

High blood sugar during pregnancy, caused by insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta.
Diabetes Insipidus:

A rare condition unrelated to diabetes mellitus.
Involves excessive removal of fluid by the kidneys.

### dataset
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, BMI, insulin level, age etc.

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
